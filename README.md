# README

This project will setup an all-in-one Grizzly installation using the combination of puppet and vagrant.

To get started:

1. Install virtualbox and vagrant
2. `cd $project-name`
3. Get the required puppet modules `./get_modules.sh`
4. `vagrant up`
5. Have a coffee

## Status
Currently, once both nodes run up the configuration is not correct. More validation of the quantum config is certainly needed.
